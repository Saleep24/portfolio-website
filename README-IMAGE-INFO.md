# MrGrammar Image

To complete the MrGrammar project card:

1. Add an image named `mrgrammar.png` to the `assets/project/` directory
2. You can download it from your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Saleep24/MrGrammar/blob/main/icons/icon128.png
3. Or create a custom image that represents your browser extension

Until an image is added, the project card might show a broken image or default placeholder.
